# Lightning photography - Forecasting a storm

I've always found thunderstorms interesting; the rapid strikes of lightning and the drums of thunder are simply excellent. What is even more so however, is capturing a great photograph of the lightning. However, unlike taking a picture of a static object, capturing the rapidity of lightning is near impossible on your first try. This guide will not go into how to properly set up your camera however, but I aim to in detail go over how to forecast the timing and severity of lightning in your area to increase your chance of taking a perfect photgraph.

## Step 1 - Upcoming forecast and weather warnings on Metoffice.
In the United Kingdom, the largest meteorology company is the Metoffice, who create the weather warnings for the country weather it is for hail, snow, rain, wind or in this case, thunderstorms. In other countries you may have an equivalent, and in that case just use that one.

Here is the forecast table, which simply works like any other - I do not think this requires any explaination. However, when you click the yellow warning button, it will bring up a useful map. It is to be noted that metoffice supports forecasting for other countries, however the accuracy may not be as on point as options tailor-made for your country.

This will then bring up our UK weather warnings page, on which we can see warnings for the next few days. In this example, you can see there is a warning in place for the United Kindgom, and this interactive map shows where abouts will be likely effected by this. 

## Step 2 - Check social media accounts / groups
If you can see the weather warning covers where you live, I would recommend going onto X (twitter) or Facebook to see further information. 

I would personally recommend [Uk Thunderstorm Updates](https://twitter.com/UKStormUpdates) on twitter for accurate information. 

Here is an example of a post:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On Sunday afternoon, multiple thunderstorms will track north across areas of Wales, NW England, N. Ireland and Scotland. Some could be severe, with frequent lightning and hail larger than 2cm. <a href="https://t.co/dxPFKjW2z7">pic.twitter.com/dxPFKjW2z7</a></p>&mdash; UK Thunderstorm Updates (@UKStormUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/UKStormUpdates/status/1789536018988765581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

We can see the graphic displays more information on the storm intensity level in each location. 

You should look around on all of your social media platforms and find an account / group that you can rely on and you find accurate yourself in your area especially.

## Step 3 - Wait...
The next step is to wait. Use multiple forecasting services to find an earliest-latest time where the thunderstorm likeliness is highest. 


## Step 4 - Lightningmaps
Once lightning has come within 50 miles of your location, you can start tracking it's location. I would recommend [Lightningmaps](lightningmaps.org) and My Lightning tracker & alerts [App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-lightning-tracker-alerts/id1175031987) and [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrustonapps.mylightningtracker&hl=en_GB&gl=US&pli=1). The app can be set to give you a notification when lightning is detected in whatever radius you choose. For me this is 30 miles, as if the lightning is travelling in the right direction, it should reach you from a 30 miles distance. 
- Another tip is to turn on volume on lightningmaps, and whilst you do something else on your PC if lightning maps is open in another tab it will make a ticking sound every time a lightning strike occurs in the zoomed in area.


## Reports
This section is to cover reports of the lightning strikes today, 12-05-2024. This is to test this method and the accuracy of the different services I am using.

In the past few minutes lightning strikes have begun. These are constant and clearly reflect a section of the weather warning issued by Metoffice, however the X post (see above) did not highlight this area in Northern Ireland and Ireland as red for risk of lightning.

### 13:25

The lightning strikes are starting to cover Northern Ireland, and approaching mainland likely hitting Wales first.
I have noticed an increase in wind and haziness, and darker (but still not black) cloud coverage in the sky. 
The air pressure is also lowering, but still not dramatically low.
